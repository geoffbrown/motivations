# Preface

*Update: January 2021*

It’s interesting to think that I’m going on 5 years of this little markdown file I’ve once published on the internet. Over the years, I’ve thought about this document a lot, but edited only a little. Just now, I thought it was a nice time to clean things up a bit. 

In the past handful of years, I’ve become a lot more reflective than I have ever been, and I’ve become quite interested in the concept of [“Momento Mori”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori) – the Stoic concept of remembering death. It’s a simple yet profound idea that’s impacted me in many positive ways in recent years. This concept has also woven itself into my ever-deepening interest in Buddhism, where death is regularly considered.

 Looking at the passage I’ve outlined 5 years ago from Scott’s book, I’m unsurprised I was moved by this concept of death acting as motivation for making life happen today! At the very least, I’m happy to be a touch consistent.

I’ve recently been inspired by [Scott Berkun’s](https://twitter.com/berkun) book [The Myths of Innovation.](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449389627/tag=scottberkunco-20) In particular, the quote at [location 3278](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoffbrown/motivations/master/list.png) on the Kindle Ebook that reads:

> “Once a week, imagine being on your deathbed (it can be fun: think Mexican Day of the Dead). Ask yourself: what will I regret not having done if I knew I was going to die today? Make a list and get to work.”

Additionally, I’ve always been inspired by [Buster Benson’s](https://twitter.com/buster) dedication to self-reflection and transparency. In particular, Buster’s [Codex Vitae.](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex2015.md)

*Note: With full apologies to Buster, I’m inspired to create my own list of beliefs as well.*

I’ve recently decided to marry the two of these ideas (the general idea behind Scott’s quote and Buster’s display of transparency on Github) into a public list of *post mortem* “regrets.” The idea being, of course, that I won’t regret these things if I take action.

I’ve also decided that I want to update this list as often as I see fit, but with the goal of not having this document become too unwieldy. Review will consist of adding and removing items to this list, and I’ll be giving myself a friendly reminder to re-read and update on a regular basis.

# Regrets

If I die today, I’ll most likely regret that I have **not** done the following (mostly) concrete things:

*Note: my aim for this list is to preemptively enumerate dying regrets, not a list of tasks or goals that should live in a to-do list.*
